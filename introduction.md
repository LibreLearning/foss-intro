What is free software? What is it and what are the implications of
a free program licence? How is free software developed? How are free software projects funded and what are the business models associated to them that we are experiencing? What motivates developers, especially volunteers, to become involved in free software projects? What are these developers like? How are their projects coordinated, and what is the software that they produce like? In short, what is the overall panorama of free software?

These are the sort of questions that we will try to answer in this document. Because although free software is increasing its presence in the media and in debates between IT professionals, and although even citizens in general are starting to talk about it, it is still for the most part an unknown quantity. And even those who are familiar with it are often aware of just some of its features, and mostly ignorant about others.

To begin with, in this chapter we will present the specific aspects of free software, focusing mainly on explaining its background for
those approaching the subject for the first time, and underlining its importance. As part of this background, we will reflect on the
definition of the term (to know what we're talking about) and on the main consequences of using (and the mere existence of) free
software.

##  The concept of software freedom

Since the early seventies we have become used to the fact that anyone marketing a program can impose (and does impose) the conditions under which the program can be used. Lending to a third party may be prohibited for example. Despite the fact that software is the most flexible and adaptable item of technology that we have, it is possible to impose the prohibition (and it frequently is imposed) to adapt it to particular needs, or to correct its errors, without the explicit agreement of the manufacturer, who normally reserves the exclusive right to these possibilities. But this is just one of the possibilities that current legislation offers: *free software*, on the other hand, offers freedoms that *proprietary software* denies.

> In this text we will use the term *proprietary software* to refer to any program that cannot be considered free software in accordance with the definition we provide later.

## Definition

So, the term "free software", as conceived by Richard Stallman in his definition (Free Software Foundation, ["Free software definition"](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) [120]), refers to the freedoms granted to its receiver, which are namely four:

* Freedom to run the program in any place, for any purpose and
forever.
* Freedom to study how it works and to adapt it to our needs. This requires access to the source code.
* Freedom to redistribute copies, so that we can help our friends
and neighbours.
* Freedom to improve the program and to release improvements to the public. This implies the availability of the source code as well.

The mechanism that guarantees these freedoms, in accordance with current legislation, is distribution under a specific licence as we will see later on (chapter 3). Through the licence, the author gives permission for the receiver of the program to exercise these freedoms, adding also any restrictions that the author may wish to apply (such as to credit the original authors in the case of a redistribution). In order for the licence to be considered free, these restrictions must not counteract the abovementioned freedoms.

> #### Note: The ambiguity of the word free

> The English term 'free software' includes the word 'free', standing for 'freedom'. But the term can mean also 'free of charge' or 'gratis', which causes a great deal of confusion. This is the reason why in some cases the English borrow Spanish/French words and refer to 'libre software', as opposed to 'gratis software'.

Therefore, the definitions of free software make no reference to the fact that it may be obtained free of charge: free software and gratis software are two very different things. However, having said this, we should also explain that due to the third freedom, anyone can redistribute a program without asking for a financial reward or
permission, which makes it practically impossible to obtain big
profits just by distributing free software: anyone who has obtained
free software may redistribute it in turn at a lower price, or even
for free.

> #### Note: Selling free software

> Despite the fact that anyone can market a given program at any price, and that this theoretically means that the redistribution price tends towards the marginal cost of copying the program, there are business models based precisely on selling free software, because there are many circumstances in which the consumer will be prepared to pay in exchange for certain other benefits, such as for example a guarantee, albeit a subjective one, for the software acquired or an added value in the choice, updating and organization of a set of programs.

From a practical point of view, several texts define more precisely what conditions a licence must fulfil in order to be considered a free software license. Among these, we highlight for their historical importance the [Free Software Definition of the Free Software Foundation](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) [120], the [Debian Guidelines for deciding whether a program is free](http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html") [104] and the definition of the term [open source by the Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.html) [215], which is very similar to the former two.
