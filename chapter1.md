What is free software? What is it and what are the implications of
a free program licence? How is free software developed? How are free software projects funded and what are the business models associated to them that we are experiencing? What motivates developers, especially volunteers, to become involved in free software projects? What are these developers like? How are their projects coordinated, and what is the software that they produce like? In short, what is the overall panorama of free software?

These are the sort of questions that we will try to answer in this document. Because although free software is increasing its presence in the media and in debates between IT professionals, and although even citizens in general are starting to talk about it, it is still for the most part an unknown quantity. And even those who are familiar with it are often aware of just some of its features, and mostly ignorant about others.

To begin with, in this chapter we will present the specific aspects of free software, focusing mainly on explaining its background for
those approaching the subject for the first time, and underlining its importance. As part of this background, we will reflect on the
definition of the term (to know what we're talking about) and on the main consequences of using (and the mere existence of) free
software.
